For every single sentence pattern, create {{flashcards_num}} flashcards based on random vocabulary words from the provided vocabulary word list. As there are {{patterns_num}} sentence patterns, there should be a total of {{flashcards_total}} created flashcards. It is imperative to note that the front should contain an interesting, conversational Korean sentence with correct grammar. The back contains its English meaning. The flashcards should only be based from the vocabulary list provided and the sentence patterns provided. It is important that the vocabulary word is used only once across all flashcards. 

Can you provide the flashcards in CSV format that I can import to Anki?
