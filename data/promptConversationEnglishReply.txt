I want to practice speaking Korean. Regardless of what language I use, respond to me only using Korean. Don't use any other language. I'm a learner, so keep your responses short. Also ask me a question in a natural way at the end of your responses. It is imperative to note that your responses should only use vocabulary from the list provided. Wherever possible, use the sentence patterns provided in your responses. If I run out of answers, I want you to also naturally ask a question about a random topic. In the next command, I will provide you a topic of conversation.
